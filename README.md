# ECTAR
ECTAR is an innovative system seamlessly integrating augmented reality (AR) and eddy current testing (ECT) techniques, realizing real-time data exchange and improving inspection efficiency. Traditional ECT methods often encounter limitations, including inefficiencies in providing intuitive real-time visualization. The proposed AR+ECT system addresses this challenge by overlaying eddy current defect maps onto the actual object surface under inspection as the scan is carried out, allowing inspectors to visualize defects instantly on the physical surface via the AR display device. The system utilizes AprilTag markers for precise pose estimation. The effect of the number of markers and the distance between the AR display device and the markers are evaluated. Experimental results demonstrate the systemâ€™s ability to process images with 1280 $\times$ 720 resolution at 30 frames per second, achieving a rotational error of just 1.17 degrees and a translational error of 1.42 mm. In addition, a deep learning-based algorithm was developed to accurately predict the depth of the detected defects, with the predicted results overlaid on top of the defect maps and the actual object in real time.
